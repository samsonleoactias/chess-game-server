# Chess!

Follow along as I build a chess game. This repo is for the game logic microservice.

## Goals

My goal is to make a web-based chess game that uses technologies I am proificient in.

### The Plan

1. ~~Logic for creating a new game~~
2. ~~Logic for user making a move on the board~~
3. ~~Naive logic for computer opponent making a move~~
4. ~~Logic for providing updated game board and possible moves each piece can do back to the client~~
5. GraphQL layer API
6. 100% test coverage
7. Algorithmic computer opponent move logic
8. AI-based computer opponent move logic
